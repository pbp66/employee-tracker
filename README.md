# Sql Employee Database

## Description

Uses an SQL database to maintain and organize its employee across various departments. SQL Database has 3 tables, employees, roles, and departments. The employees are assigned roles from the roles department and assigned managers from within the same employees table. Roles is assigned a department from the departments table. Together, these 3 tables provide the backbone for an employee information system.

```

Using mysql2 turned out to be a larger challenge than expected due to how the inputs are parameterized. For values and tables, this usually wasn't an issue. For column names though, I would regularly experience errors since the column names being inserted into the query were wrapped with single quotes. As such, I could not rely on previous classes and methods I had built to autogenerate sql queries. Instead, most of them had to be manually created extending the completion time for this project.
